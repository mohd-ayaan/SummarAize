### SummarAIze

## My Technical Approach
For the technical assessment, I developed a full-stack **Document Summary Assistant** to demonstrate proficiency in building a complete, real-world application. My approach centered on a clean, scalable architecture with a clear separation of concerns.

The application‚Äôs front end, built with **React**, provides a simple, intuitive user interface with drag-and-drop and file-picker functionality for document uploads. It includes visual feedback like loading states for an optimal user experience, and a polished Neumorphism design for visual appeal.

The back end is powered by a **Node.js/Express** server that acts as a central API. Upon receiving a file, the server orchestrates the entire process. It routes PDF files to a Python microservice that uses **PyMuPDF** for text extraction, and images to the same service for **OCR** using the **Tesseract** engine. This separation was a key decision to leverage Python's strong ecosystem for specialized tasks while keeping the core server lightweight.

Finally, the extracted text is sent to the **Gemini API**, which intelligently generates a summary based on the user's selected length (short, medium, long). The final summary is then returned to the front end and displayed to the user. This architecture is robust, efficient, and easily scalable for a production environment.


## üìù Description

**SummarAIze** is a full-stack web application that simplifies document analysis by generating smart, AI-powered summaries from any uploaded PDF or image. The application provides an intuitive drag-and-drop interface, making it easy for users to quickly get the essential information and key points from their documents. It is a powerful tool for students, researchers, and professionals who need to digest large amounts of information efficiently.

This project was built as a technical assessment to demonstrate proficiency in building a practical, real-world application with a modern MERN stack and a Python microservice.

## üß∞ Features

* **Document Upload:** Seamlessly upload PDF files and image files via a drag-and-drop or file picker interface.
* **Intelligent Summarization:** Automatically generate summaries of varying lengths (short, medium, long) using a powerful AI model.
* **OCR Integration:** Extracts text from image files (scanned documents) using **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)** technology.
* **Responsive Design:** The user interface is designed to be mobile-responsive for use on different devices.
* **Efficient Backend:** Utilizes a Node.js backend with a Python child process for robust text extraction and AI API communication.

## üöÄ Live Demo

### Ingestion: Document Upload
![Ingestion: Document Upload](Images/ingestion.png)

This shows the initial state of the application, ready for a user to upload a document via the drag-and-drop zone or file picker.

### Processing: The Loading State
![Processing: The Loading State](Images/processing.png)

Once a file is uploaded and the "Get Summary" button is clicked, a loading state appears to provide visual feedback to the user while the backend is processing the document and generating the summary.

### Transformation: The Final Summary

This shows the final output, a structured and formatted summary from the AI, highlighting the key points of the uploaded document.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
* Node.js (LTS version)
* Python 3.x
* npm
* Tesseract OCR engine (must be installed and in your system's PATH)

### Steps

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name

# Install frontend dependencies
npm install --prefix frontend

# Install backend dependencies
npm install --prefix backend

# Start the frontend
npm start --prefix frontend

# Start the backend in a separate terminal
npm start --prefix backend
```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the `/backend` directory with the following variable:

```bash
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
```
### Project Structure
<pre><code>
/document-summary-assistant
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ /frontend
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ /backend
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ server.js
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ process_document.py
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json (root)
</code></pre>

### API Endpoints
The backend exposes a single API endpoint for document processing.

**POST /upload-document**

*Accepts a multipart/form-data request with a document file and a summaryLength parameter.

*Success Response: Returns a JSON object with the generated summary.
```bash
{
  "message": "Summary generated successfully!",
  "summary": "Here is your summarized content..."
}
```
### Testing Instructions
You can test the API endpoint using a tool like Postman.

*Endpoint: `https://summaraize-fksu.onrender.com/upload-document`

*Method: `POST`

*Body: `form-data`

`document`: File (select your PDF or image)

`summaryLength`: Text (select short, medium, or long)
